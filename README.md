# R-repository
(WIP:) A self-made function repository for common R functions and packages used in daily. 

### Introduction and purpose

This has been a long time coming. I have spent far too much time searching through new and old scripts to find that one function I used to solve a specific problem. Even as recently as the end of 2021 I spent three hours searching for specific lines of codes so I could solve the sam eproblem for a new piece of work. No more!

It had been on my mind for quite some time to create a simple repository of common functions I use aswell as more bespoke functions used as a one issue. Atleast then they are all in one place so I can work more efficently. 

In addition, in my work-area there are freqeunt new joiners. I am actively sharing best practice dmeonstrating useful R packages and code. I hope to encourage more wide-spread use of code, automation and R. I observe the relucatance to move away from excel to learning R. I was the same until I was forced, now I love coding. I wish I had something similar when I first started as this would have saved me many hours of my life on stack overflow!
