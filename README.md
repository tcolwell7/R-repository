# R-repository
(WIP:) A self-made function repository for common R functions and packages used day to day.

### Introduction and purpose

This has been a long time coming. I have spent far too much time searching through new and old scripts to find that one function I used to solve a specific problem. Even as recently as the end of 2021 I spent three hours searching for specific lines of codes so I could solve the same problem for a new piece of work. **No more!**

It had been on my mind for quite some time to create a simple repository of common functions I use aswell as more bespoke functions. Atleast then they are all in one place so I can work more efficiently. 

In addition, in my work-area there are freqeunt new joiners. I am actively sharing best practice demonstrating useful R packages and code. I hope to encourage more wide-spread use of coding, automation and R for which I hope this repository can help with.

I observe the relucatance to move away from excel to learning R. I was the same until I was forced and now I love coding. I wish I had something similar when I first started as this would have saved me many hours of my life on stack overflow! 


### Contents:

This is an on-going project - so not all functions or files have been created. 

1. Tidyverse - Data wrangling, exploration, cleaning, transformations - the package I use daily for everything. 
2. Openxlsx - Automation of spreadsheet outputs. Don't fancy saving and formatting a dozen spreadsheets at a time? Learn openxlsx. 
3. Janitor - Write clean, concise and smart code using simple functions which will improve coding efficiency. 
4. Stringr - String manipulaiton made easy.
5. loops&lists - loop and store data easily enabling simple automation of repetative tasks.
6. Functions - tbc.
7. ggplot - tbc.
