# Testing ggplot theme

ggplot has several useful pre-maid themes for aethetic charts which saves time creating your own theme. The following notebook generates several plots and visualises them to enable quick and easy access to what themes look like - so you don't have to plot each one each time to test them out. 

## Line plot testing

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(openxlsx) 
library(janitor)
library(readxl)
library(stringr)
library(rlang)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)  


`%notin%` <- Negate(`%in%`) # Custom negate function


load("data/Trade_datasets.RData")

path<-setwd(stringr::str_extract(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path,".+[/]")) 

# filter trade data for line plot 

df <- trade_annual %>% filter(iso2 %in% c("DE","FR","IE"))

line_plot <- 
  df %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = year,
      y = total,
      color = country
     )
    )+
  geom_line()

print(line_plot)

```

```{r}

# line plot using ggplot default 
LAB = labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Trade (Â£'000s)",
       title = "Total trade time-series",
       subtitle = "Top UK-EU trading partners",
       caption = "source: ONS"
  )
line_plot + LAB
  

```


### ggplot themes examples

Testing ggplot themes for a line plot

#### theme_minimal

removes axis lines and ticks. Plain white background. Light grey grid lines

```{r}
line_plot + theme_minimal() + LAB
```

#### theme_bw


``` {r}

line_plot + theme_bw() + LAB


```

## R Markdown


This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
